= Release Notes

== Version 0.1.0
* Initial version

=== Version 0.1.1
* Added the functionality to add exceptions with are ignored by the CircuitBreaker

=== Version 0.1.2
* Added the feature to get Metrics for function executions

=== Version 0.1.3
* Added a static factory method for the CircuitBreakerConfig builder

=== Version 0.1.4
* Added the feature to retry a failed function

=== Version 0.1.5
* Added builders to simplify chaining of decorators

=== Version 0.1.6
* Renamed project to javaslang-circuitbreaker

=== Version 0.1.7
* Fixed Issue #2
* Issue #3 Added a listener mechanism for state transitions

== Version 0.2.0
* Removed Dropwizard Metrics, because its a too heavy dependency for such a lightweight library.
* Changed the way exceptions can be handled. You have to provide a Predicate now instead of a list of exceptions to ignore.

== Version 0.3.0
* The CircuitBreaker is based on a Ring Bit Buffer and a failure rate now.

=== Version 0.3.1
* Changed the visibility of CircuitBreakerUtils.isCallPermitted to public.

=== Version 0.3.2
* CircuitBreakerRegistry has a new method which takes a Supplier of a CircuitBreakerConfig so that the CircuitBreakerConfig is only created when needed.

=== Version 0.3.3
* CircuitBreaker has a new method `getCircuitBreakerConfig` which allows to retrieve the CircuitBreakerConfig of the CircuitBreaker.
* Renamed the state HALF_CLOSED to HALF_OPEN to match the pattern description of Martin Fowler.

=== Version 0.3.4
* Added a Metrics interface to the CircuitBreaker which allows to retrieve current statistics like failureRate and number of buffer calls.

== Version 0.4.0
* Updated javaslang from 2.0.0-RC4 to 2.0.1

== Version 0.5.0
* Updated javaslang from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2
* Fixed issue #6: The CB changes to OPEN state when the failure rate is above (>) the threshold, but it should be above or equal (>=).

== Version 0.6.0
* Updated javaslang from 2.0.2 to 2.0.4

== Version 0.7.0
* Added rxjava 2.0.1 as a dependency
* Issue #13: CircuitBreaker should publish events as an event stream and clients should be able to subscribe
* Issue #10: Reorder arguments in decorator methods
* PR #19: Add a backoff function feature, to modify the waiting interval between failures
* Renamed root package from javaslang to io.github.resilience4j, because the project had to leave the Javaslang GitHub organisation

=== Version 0.7.1
* Changed Event stream return type from Observable to Flowable
* Events contain a create time
* Added getThrowable method to CircuitBreakerOnErrorEvent which was missing
* Added CircuitBreakerOnIgnoredErrorEvent to signal exceptions which have been ignored because of a custom predicate
* Added getMaxNumberOfBufferedCalls and getNumberOfSuccessfulCalls methods to Metrics interface

== Version 0.8.0
* Added the SingleOperator interface to CircuitBreakerOperator
* Issue #12: Added a new RateLimiter decorator
* Added a new Cache decorator
* Removed CacheEventConsumer and CircuitBreakerEventConsumer and created a generic CircularEventConsumer
* Added a StopWatch which is used to measure the elapsed time of decorated calls. CircuitBreakerEvents also contain the elapsed duration of a call now.
* Issue #33: Added the ability to 'force' state transitions manually
* Issue #38: A CircuitBreaker records not permitted calls when the state is OPEN and emits a event for each attempt. The metric "numberOfNotPermittedCalls" can be access via CircuitBreaker.Metrics
* Issue #39: A CircuitBreaker should copy the previous RingBitSet values during state transition from HALF_OPEN to CLOSED
* Updated javaslang from 2.0.4 to 2.0.5
* Updated rxjava from 2.0.1 to 2.0.3

=== Version 0.8.1
* Issue #41: Added a method to the CircuitBreakerRegistry which returns a list of all managed CircuitBreaker instances
* Issue #42: Added a new EventConsumerRegistry which can be used to create and manage instances of EventConsumers.

=== Version 0.8.2
* Issue #43: Added a new higher-order function to decorate a method which returns a CompletableFuture.
* Issue #49: Added execute methods to CircuitBreaker interface and Decorators builder. This makes it easier to decorate and call a function at once.
* Updated rxjava from 2.0.3 to 2.0.6
* Updated slf4j-api from 1.7.12 to 1.7.24

== Version 0.9.0
* PR #59: Project has been renamed to resilience4j and has been modularized.
* PR #59: Renamed packages from io.github.robwin to io.github.resilience4j.
* PR #76: Module for integration with Retrofit.
* PR #82: Module for integration with Ratpack.
* PR #80: Resilience4j metrics reporting with Dropwizard metrics.
* PR #81: Resilience4j metrics reporting with Prometheus.
* PR #103, #104, #101: Various improvements of rxJava integration.
* Issue #61: Permissions aren't available from the first cycle in AtomicRateLimiter.
* Performance improvements of ConcurrentEvictingQueue
